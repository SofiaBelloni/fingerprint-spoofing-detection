The goal of the project is the development of a classifier to detect whether a fingerprint image represents an authentic or spoofed fingerprint. The fingerprint images are represented by means of embeddings, i.e. low-dimensional representations of images obtained by mapping images to allow dimensional manifold.
The dataset consist of synthetic data, and embeddings had signficantly lower dimensions than real use cases.
We are going to analyze different classifiers in order to understand which model fit better
for the dataset, and we are going to compute the cost for each model.
